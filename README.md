Board Game Project
Overview
This project is a Java-based board game developed as part of a university assignment.
It demonstrates the use of key data structures (lists, queues, stacks, trees, hash tables), object-oriented programming principles, and UML design practices.

Project Structure
src/
Contains all Java source code organized into logical packages and classes.
The main functionality of the board game is implemented here, including the game logic, player handling, and board management.

uml/
Includes UML diagrams (class diagrams, sequence diagrams) that document the architecture and interaction between classes.

README.md
Provides information about the project structure and contents.

other files
Supporting documents, reports, or diagrams related to the project.

Features
Implementation of core data structures in Java.

Encapsulation of game logic using clean object-oriented design.

UML diagrams to visualize system architecture.

Modular and expandable codebase.

Clear documentation and comments within the source code.

How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git

Navigate to the src directory.

Compile and run the Java files using your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) or via terminal:
javac *.java
java MainClassName

Notes
This project was developed for educational purposes and is not intended for production use.

The focus was on proper Java programming practices, clean code organization, and demonstrating understanding of data structures and software design patterns.
